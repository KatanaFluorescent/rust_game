# Jason in the loop

Welcome to this game, yet uncomplete. The concept of this game is that you can record past version of yourself and make them play in a loop, and interact with them (for example, jump on a clone to get to higher places)

## Quick overview of commands : 

* `Z` for jump
* `Q`, `D` respectively for left and right
* `Spacebar` for respawning
* `J` for attacking

**For recording clones** :

* `K` starts a recording which means all your actions will be recorded. Hitting `K` again deletes the recording that is ongoing
* `L` : if a recording has been started previously (by pressing `K`), spawns a clone and stops the recording. If no recording is ongoing, does nothing
* `I` : deletes the last spawned clone

## How to play the game :

1. Install rust : follow the instructions for your platform on [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone this repo : open a terminal and type ```git clone git@github.com:turbobato/Jason-in-the-Loop.git```
3. Move to the folder game (`cd game`) and run the game with `cargo run`
